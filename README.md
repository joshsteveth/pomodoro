##Simple apps to send notification in certain interval
Currently only supports timeout and icon (because for me that's enough, and I'm too lazy lol)

###View sample main.ini to configure, and simply "go run *.go"
```
//list of icons:
//face-angel        face-laugh      face-smile
//face-angry        face-monkey     face-smirk
//face-cool         face-plain      face-surprise
//face-crying       face-raspberry  face-tired
//face-devilish     face-sad        face-uncertain
//face-embarrassed  face-sick       face-wink
//face-kiss         face-smile-big  face-worried
```
